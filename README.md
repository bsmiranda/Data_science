# My first steps in Data Science

Hello, welcome to my first  **Data Science**  portfolio! Here I begin my first studies in data analysis, statistics, modeling and data visualization.

This training in Data Science is offered by  **Alura**, a 100% digital school that offers courses in technology and digital business.

 
## Projects

This training includes Data Science, Machine Learning, SQL with Microsoft SQL Server, BI and Data Warehouse with Pentaho, BI and Data Warehouse with SQL Server and Power BI, SQL with MySQL Server from Oracle, SQL with Oracle Database, Python for Data Science, Mathematics for Programming and Data Science and Datomic.

**Starting with Data Science:** Learning to load a real-world data set, doing data analysis in an exploratory way using Searborn, Matplotlib, SciPy and Pandas.

[2_Database.ipynb](https://github.com/bsmiranda/Data_science/blob/master/2_Database.ipynb "2_Database.ipynb")


**Data Science models:** Working with time series and analyzing data in a practical and realistic way. Use of linear regression techniques to demonstrate the impacts of variables made available in a dataset.

_Note: This project is ongoing._
